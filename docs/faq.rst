.. _faq-why-instant:

Why does :class:`~whenever.Instant` exist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since you can also express a moment in time using
:class:`~whenever.ZonedDateTime`
you might wonder why :class:`~whenever.Instant` exists.
The reason it exists is precisely *because* it doesn't include a timezone.
By using :class:`~whenever.Instant`, you clearly express that you only
care about when something happened, and don't care about the local time.

Consider the difference in intent between these two classes:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   class ChatMessage:
       sent: Instant
       content: str


.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   class ChatMessage:
       sent: ZonedDateTime
       content: str

In the first example, it's clear that you only care about the moment when
chat messages were sent.
In the second, you communicate that you also store the user's local time.
This intent is crucial for reasoning about the code,
and extending it correctly (e.g. with migrations, API endpoints, etc).

.. _faq-why-system-tz:

Why does :class:`~whenever.SystemDateTime` exist?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While it may not make sense for server-type applications to use the system timezone,
it's often useful for CLI tools or desktop applications.

Using :class:`~whenever.SystemDateTime` has the following advantages:

- In contrast to :class:`~whenever.OffsetDateTime`,
  :class:`~whenever.SystemDateTime` knows about the system's timezone changes,
  enabling DST-safe arithmetic.
- In contrast to :class:`~whenever.ZonedDateTime`,
  :class:`~whenever.SystemDateTime` doesn't require the system be configured with an IANA timezone.
  While this is often the case, it's not guaranteed.

Of course, feel free to work with :class:`~whenever.ZonedDateTime` if
you know the system's IANA timezone. You can use
the `tzlocal <https://pypi.org/project/tzlocal/>`_ library to help with this.

Why the name ``PlainDateTime``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This has been an oft-discussed topic. Several names were considered
for the concept of a "datetime without a timezone".

Each option had its pros and cons.

- Why not ``NaiveDateTime``? This name is already used in the standard library,
  which does give it recognition. However, "naive" is a decidedly negative term.
  While datetimes without a timezone *can* be used in a naive way
  by developers who don't understand the implications, they are not inherently wrong to use.
- Why not ``CivilDateTime``? This is the most "technically correct" name,
  as it refers to the `time as used in civilian life <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_time>`_.
  This name is most notably used in Jiff (Rust) and Abseil (C++) libraries.
  While this niche name is a boon to these langauges,
  Python tends to favor more common, non-jargon names:
  "dict" over "hashmap", "list" over "array", etc.
- Why not ``LocalDateTime``? This is the name that ISO8601 gives to the concept,
  also making it a "technically correct" name.
  However, the term "local" has become overloaded in the Python world
  where it often refers to the system timezone.

While ``PlainDateTime`` is not perfect, it has the following advantages:

- Javascript's new Temporal API uses this name. There's significant
  overlap between Python and Javascript developers,
  so this name is likely to be familiar as its popularity grows.
- It's a name that is easy to understand and remember, also for non-native speakers.

Common critiques of ``PlainDateTime`` are:

- *The name doesn't convey any meaning in itself.*
  This is also a strength. It *is* simply a date+time. Yes, it can
  be used to represent a local time, but it doesn't have to be.
- *The name is defined by what it is not.*
  Actually, it's really common to name things in opposition to something else.
  Think of: "*stainless* steel", "*plain* text", or "*serverless* computing".


.. _faq-leap-seconds:

Are leap seconds supported?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leap seconds are unsupported.
Taking leap seconds into account is a complex and niche feature,
which is not needed for the vast majority of applications.
This decision is consistent with other modern libraries
(e.g. NodaTime, Temporal) and standards (RFC 5545, Unix time) which
do not support leap seconds.

One improvement that is planned: allowing the parsing of leap seconds,
which are then truncated to 59 seconds.

Why not adopt Rust's Chrono API?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I did consider this initially, but decided against it for the following reasons:

- While I love Rust's functional approach to error handling,
  it doesn't map well to idiomatic Python.
- At the time of writing, Chrono is only on version 0.4 and its API is still evolving.
- Chrono's timezone functionality can't handle disambiguation in gaps yet
  (see `here <https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/1448>`_)

.. _faq-why-not-dropin:

Why no drop-in replacement for ``datetime``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixing the issues with the standard library requires a different API.
Keeping the same API would mean that the same issues would remain.
Also, inheriting from the standard library would result in brittle code:
many popular libraries expect ``datetime`` *exactly*,
and `don't work <https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/issues/289#issue-371964426>`_
with `subclasses <https://github.com/sdispater/pendulum/issues/131#issue-241088629>`_.

.. _faq-production-ready:

Is it production-ready?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core functionality is complete and mostly stable.
The goal is to reach 1.0 soon, but the API may change until then.
Of course, it's still a relatively young project, so the stability relies
on you to try it out and report any issues!

Where do the benchmarks come from?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More information about the benchmarks can be found in the ``benchmarks`` directory
of the repository.

How can I use the pure-Python version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever is implemented both in Rust and in pure Python.
By default, the Rust extension is used, as it's faster and more memory-efficient.
But you can opt out of it if you prefer the pure-Python version,
which has a smaller disk footprint and works on all platforms.

.. note::

   On PyPy, the Python implementation is automatically used. No need to configure anything.

To opt out of the Rust extension and use the pure-Python version,
install from the source distribution with the ``WHENEVER_NO_BUILD_RUST_EXT`` environment variable set:

.. code-block:: bash

   WHENEVER_NO_BUILD_RUST_EXT=1 pip install whenever --no-binary whenever

You can check if the Rust extension is being used by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import whenever; print(whenever._EXTENSION_LOADED)"

.. note::

   If you're using Poetry or another third-party package manager,
   you should consult its documentation on opting out of binary wheels.


What's the performance of the pure-Python version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In casual benchmarks, the pure-Python version is about 10x slower than the Rust version,
making it 5x slower than the standard library but still (in general) faster than Pendulum and Arrow.

What about ``dateutil``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I haven't included it in the comparison since dateutil is more of an
*extension* to datetime, while Whenever (and Pendulum and Arrow)
are more like replacements.

That said, here are my thoughts on dateutil: while it certainly provides
useful helpers (especially for parsing and arithmetic), it doesn't solve the
(IMHO) most glaring issues with the standard library: DST-safety and typing
for naive/aware. These are issues that only a full replacement can solve.

Why did you use ``pyo3_ffi`` instead of ``PyO3``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two main reasons:

1. The higher-level binding library PyO3 has a small additional overhead for function calls,
   which can be significant for small functions. Whenever has a lot of small functions.
   Only with ``pyo3_ffi`` can these functions be on par (or faster) than the standard library.
   The overhead has decreased in recent versions of PyO3, but it's still there.
2. I was eager to learn to use the bare C API of Python, in order to better
   understand how Python extension modules and PyO3 work under the hood.

Additional advantages of ``pyo3_ffi`` are:

- Its API is more stable than PyO3's, which is still evolving.
- It allows support for per-interpreter GIL, and free-threaded Python,
  which are not yet supported by PyO3.

Why can't I subclass Whenever classes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever classes aren't meant to be subclassed.
There's no plan to change this due to the following reasons:

1. The benefits of subclassing are limited.
   If you want to extend the classes, composition is a better way to do it.
   Alternatively, you can use Python's dynamic features to create
   something that behaves like a subclass.
2. For a class to support subclassing properly, a lot of extra work is needed.
   It also adds many subtle ways to misuse the API, that are hard to control.
3. Enabling subclassing would undo some performance optimizations.
